# Nameless Plugin configuration

# Permissions have to be set the following way:
# you need to check the groups' ids in your NamelessMC web setup
# and here you have to set the permissions like the example
# down here. If the player has a permission which has been set
# down here, then the group in which the permission is set will
# be applied to the player if it's registered in the web.
