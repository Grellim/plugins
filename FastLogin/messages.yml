# In order to split a message into separate lines you could just make a new line, but keep the '
# Example:
# bla: '&aFirst line
# Second line
# Third line'

# If you want to disable a message, you can just set it to a empty value.
# In this case no message will be sent
# Example:
# bla: ''

# Switch mode is activated and a new (non-whitelist) cracked player tries to join

# Player is already set to be cracked

# Admin wanted to change the premium of a user that isn't known to the plugin
player-unknown: '&4Player não encontrado'

# ========= Bukkit/Spigot ================

# The user skipped the authentication, because it was a premium player
auto-login: '&2Logado automaticamente'

# The user was auto registered on the first join. The user account will be registered to protect it from cracked players
# The password can be used if the mojang servers are down and you still want your premium users to login (PLANNED)
auto-register: '&2Registrado por ser original, sua senha: %password
Gostaria de muda-la?'

# Player is not able to toggle the premium state of other players
no-permission: '&4Sem permissão'

# Although the console can toggle the premium state, it's not possible for the console itself.
# Because the console is not a user. (obviously, isn't it?)
no-console: '&4You are not a player. You cannot toggle the premium state for YOURSELF as a console'

# The user wants to toggle premium state, but BungeeCord support is enabled. This means the server have to communicate
# with the BungeeCord first which will establish a connection with the database server.
wait-on-proxy: '&6Exigindo respostas...'

# When ProtocolLib is enabled and the plugin is unable to continue handling a login request after a requested premium
# authentication. In this state the client expects a success packet with a encrypted connection or disconnect packet.
# So we kick the player, if we cannot encrypt the connection. In other situation (example: premium name check),
# the player will be just authenticated as cracked
error-kick: '&4Error ocorrido'

# The server sends a verify token within the premium authentication request. If this doesn't match on response,
# it could be another client sending malicious packets
invalid-verify-token: '&4Token inválido'

# The client sent no request join server request to the mojang servers which would proof that it's owner of that
# account. Only modified clients would do this.
invalid-session: '&4Sessão inválida'

# The client sent a malicious packet without a login request packet
invalid-requst: '&4Requerimento inválido'

# Message if the bukkit isn't fully started to inject the packets
not-started: '&cServidor iniciando, aguarde...'

# Warning message if a user invoked /premium command

a conta será bloqueada. Digite /premium novamente para confirmar.'
